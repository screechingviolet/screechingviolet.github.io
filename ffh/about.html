<h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>In the past decade, food waste has dramatically increased, and it is having disastrous impacts on our environment. Food waste in Singapore is a big deal. Studies have shown that restaurants and schools contribute about 33 billion pounds of food waste each year.
<br>While food waste is a big problem, so is poverty. Around 23,000 children in Singapore are malnourished and additionally, 1 in every 10 Singaporeans lack basic needs. 
Singapore is thought of as a luxurious, high-end country, but what people don’t realise is that there are tons of people living in poverty. Food is a basic human need which many cannot afford. It takes around SG$1000 each month to feed a family of four. In Singapore, there are people who barely have SG$1800 to live off of per month, so after paying for food, they’re left with only 800 for all other necessities. 
That’s why we decided to come up with a solution that could kill both birds with the same stone.

<h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>We covered food insecurity in Singapore as well as a food-related topic to do an independent inquiry on in school recently. We were all very interested in these food-related issues. Food insecurity for people in poverty and food waste are two big issues we all focused on.
Essentially, we take foods that are close to expiring from supermarkets, restaurants (fresh leftover food) and repurpose them into meals for the less fortunate who are suffering from food insecurity. We would sell these to them for cheaper prices, but we’d also make sure that we provide them with a balanced diet, considering everything from nutrients to dietary requirements. 
With this, we have developed a website to inform people about the issue and our solution and an app where people can order ready-made meals.
